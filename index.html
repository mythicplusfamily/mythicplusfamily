We are a PvE guild, focused on Mythic+ content. We primarly focus on getting players to Keystone Master (KSM, 2000 rating) and Keystone Hero (KSH, 2500 rating) each season, although we do have players that like to push their keys as high as they can. </p> </div> <div class="bg-slate-800 col-span-1"> <div class="my-6"> <a class="bg-slate-900 block m-4 px-6 py-2 rounded-xl text-center text-white" href="https://discord.com/invite/KG63YGAPX2">Discord</a> </div> <div class="mt-6"> <a class="bg-slate-900 block m-4 px-6 py-2 rounded-xl text-center text-white" href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/thral-us-mythic-plus-family-lf-active-players-for-pushing-keys/1795909">Recruitment Post</a> </div> <div id="rankings"></div> </div> </div> </body></html>
